# Cookie Stand Project

This webpage was a lab assignment for my Code201 course at Code Fellows. I developed a webpage that showcases Pat's Salmon Cookies. It includes a sales page with a table that randomizes the number of cookies sold each hour for each store location with daily and hourly totals. This application also includes a form which allows the user to input new restaurant information and subsequently renders the new restaurant data onto the webpage and the table.
