# Cookie Stand Project

I created webpage that showcases Pat's Salmon Cookies. It contains a homepage styled with CSS, a sales page with a table that randomizes the number of cookies sold each hour for each store location with daily and hourly totals, and a form where you can input new restaurant locations into the table.
